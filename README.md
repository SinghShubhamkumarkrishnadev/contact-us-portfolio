This is an important step! You’ll get **YOUR\_SERVICE\_ID**, **YOUR\_TEMPLATE\_ID**, and **YOUR\_PUBLIC\_KEY** from the **EmailJS** dashboard once you create an account and set up your service and email template.

### ✅ Step-by-step guide to get these values:

---

### 1️⃣ **Create an EmailJS account**

1. Go to [https://www.emailjs.com/](https://www.emailjs.com/).
2. Click on **Sign Up** and create your account.
3. Verify your email if required.

---

### 2️⃣ **Add an Email Service (YOUR\_SERVICE\_ID)**

1. After logging in, go to the **Email Services** tab.
2. Click **Add New Service**.
3. Choose a provider like **Gmail**, **Outlook**, or use **SMTP**.
4. Follow the steps to connect your email account.
5. After setup, you’ll see a **Service ID** like:

   ```
   service_xxxxxx
   ```

   ✅ This is your `YOUR_SERVICE_ID`.

---

### 3️⃣ **Create an Email Template (YOUR\_TEMPLATE\_ID)**

1. Go to the **Email Templates** tab.
2. Click **Create New Template**.
3. Name it something like “Contact Form”.
4. In the template, use placeholders like:

   ```
   From: {{from_name}} <{{from_email}}>
   Message: {{message}}
   ```
5. Save the template.
6. You’ll see a **Template ID** like:

   ```
   template_xxxxxx
   ```

   ✅ This is your `YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID`.

---

### 4️⃣ **Get your Public Key (YOUR\_PUBLIC\_KEY)**

1. Click on your profile or go to the **Account** section.
2. Under **API Keys**, you’ll find the **Public Key**.
3. It looks like:

   ```
   user_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```

   ✅ This is your `YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY`.

---

### ✅ Important Notes:

* These values are safe to use in frontend code, but for production use, you should still protect them or use environment variables.
* You can limit usage by setting up restrictions in EmailJS.
* Always test your form in development before deploying.

---

### Example usage after replacing the placeholders:

```javascript
emailjs.send(
  'service_abcd1234',   // YOUR_SERVICE_ID
  'template_xyz5678',   // YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID
  {
    from_name: formData.name,
    from_email: formData.email,
    message: formData.message
  },
  'user_a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0' // YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY
)
```
